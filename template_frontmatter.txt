## 1 Background

- Your username;

## 11 Users’ Responsibilities

Users with licensed access are the only ones in the Subscriber’s organization authorized to access the products and to communicate directly with Company about service requests.

## 12 Service Commitment of {{uptime_percentage}} Uptime

12.1 Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Platform available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least {{uptime_percentage}} during any monthly cycle (the “Service Commitment”). Subject to the SLA Exclusions in section 18, if we do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit. A report of Monthly Uptime Percentage will be provided at status.example.com to the Subscriber.

12.2 A Monthly Uptime Percentage of {{uptime_percentage}} means that we will do our best efforts to ensure that you will experience no more than 21.54 minutes per month of Unavailability.

## 13 Service Credits

13.1 Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges due on your invoice for the billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. If the billing cycle is anything other than annual, then the Service Credit amounts to a percentage of the prorated annual fee.

13.2 The Service Credits are applied proportionally to the Platform Services that were Unavailable, in accordance with the schedule below:

- For Monthly Uptime Percentage less than {{uptime_percentage}} but equal to or greater than 99.0%, you will be eligible for a Service Credit of {{service_credit_percentage_tier_1}} of the charges attributable to the affected resources.
- For Monthly Uptime Percentage less than 99.0%, you will be eligible for a Service Credit of {{service_credit_percentage_tier_2}} of the charges attributable to the affected resources.

13.3 For example, if the Platform is Unavailable for 22 minutes in a given month, you would be eligible for a Service Credit for {{service_credit_percentage_tier_1}} of the Service Fee for the month.

13.4 The total amount of Service Credit payable cannot exceed {{max_service_credit_percentage}} of the License Fee, as stated in the Service Order Form, for the monthly period in which the Unavailability occurs. The Service Credit cannot be applied to non-software fees such as Professional Service Fees. We will apply any Service Credits only against future payments due from you. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from Company. Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.

## 14 Sole Remedy

Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the Services is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.

## 15 Credit Request and Payment Procedures

15.1 To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by emailing {{finance_email}}. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us within {{credit_request_days}} calendar days after which the incident occurred and must include:

- the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject;
- the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;
- the Subscriber name; and
- logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

15.2 If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such a request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credit to you in the billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above may delay you from receiving a Service Credit.

## 16 Initial Response Times

Company offers support services with the following initial response times based on the level of priority:

- Priority Level 4:
    - Issue description: General request for information, such as user administration, install/move/add/change/delete requests, software installation, and/or product feature development.

    - Sana will work together with the Subscriber to address requests for information in a timely and commercially reasonable manner.

    - Initial Commitment response time: {{level_3_response_time}} business hours
    - Company will work together with the Subscriber to mutually prioritize and schedule a resolution into regular continuous delivery.
    - If no solution is available, Level 3 support technicians will escalate to a lower level.
- Priority Level 2:

    - Initial Commitment response time: {{level_2_response_time}} business hours
    - The issue will be worked on until fixed or an appropriate workaround is applied.
    - Updates are provided at the end of every business day.

    - Initial Commitment response time: {{level_1_response_time}} business hours
    - The issue will be worked on with the highest priority until fixed or an appropriate workaround is applied.
    - Updates provided every 4 hours.

17.2 Recovery Point Objective (“RPO”): The RPO shall not exceed {{rpo_hours}} hours as the maximum acceptable level of data loss following an unplanned event, such as a force majeure event, or any other business or technical disruption that could cause such data loss.

## 18 SLA Exclusions

18.1 The Service Commitment does not apply to any Unavailability:

- That results from a suspension or remedial action;
- Caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event, Subscriber’s internet access, or issues beyond the demarcation point of the Platform;
- That results from any actions or inactions of you or your third parties;
